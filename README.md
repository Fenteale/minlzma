# minlzma
The Minimal LZMA (minlzma) project aims to provide a minimalistic, cross-platform, highly commented, standards-compliant C library (minlzlib) for decompressing LZMA2-encapsulated compressed data in LZMA format within an XZ container, as can be generated with Python 3.6, 7-zip, and xzutils. Additionally, a simple, portable, command-line tool (minlzdec) is provided for excercising the functionality on a provided input file.
